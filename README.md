# Incorrect Falsy Value Handling in Conditional

This example demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: the incorrect handling of falsy values in a conditional statement.

## Bug Description
The `foo` function intends to handle cases where either `a` or `b` is zero. However, it only checks for strict equality (`===`) with 0. This is insufficient because other falsy values, such as `''`, `null`, `undefined`, and `NaN`, will also cause unexpected behavior.

## Bug Solution
The solution uses loose equality (`==`) to check if the value is falsy.  A better solution would be explicit checks for the expected falsy values to ensure robust behavior.  This allows the function to correctly manage different scenarios involving falsy values.
